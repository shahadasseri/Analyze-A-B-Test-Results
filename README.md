# Project title:
Analyze-A-B-Test-Results

## Overview 
 I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users. My goal was to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### What Software Do I Need?

To complete this project, you will require the following softwares:

- Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, StatsModels)
- Jupyter Notebook
